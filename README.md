I tried a shoot-em-up today. The idea I though of while working was to
have a constant stream of power ups. Each power up boosts up your fire
rate. However your fire rate is always slowly ticking down. So you
have to keep getting power ups.

Enemies are red. You're yellow. Power ups are purple.

- _Time to first interaction_: 6 minutes
- _Time until first bullets fired_: 15 minutes
- _Time until rate of fire implemented_: 23 minutes
- _Time until power ups added_: 35 minutes
- _Time until enemies added_: ~65 minutes

I liked the feeling of trying to keep your rate of fire up. The enemy
I managed to implement doesn't seem that interesting. Maybe it could
be better with enemies that gel with the core mechanic.
